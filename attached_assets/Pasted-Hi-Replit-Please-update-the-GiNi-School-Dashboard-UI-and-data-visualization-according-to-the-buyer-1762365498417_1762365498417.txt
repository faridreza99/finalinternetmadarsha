Hi Replit,

Please update the GiNi School Dashboard UI and data visualization according to the buyer’s shared reference (image example).

🧩 1️⃣ Dashboard Design Improvements

Use the buyer’s example layout for reference.
Make the dashboard visually cleaner, balanced, and more professional.
Ensure it’s fully responsive and works on all devices.

✅ Top Section (Cards):

Total Students Using AI

Total AI Interactions

Active Classes

Weekly Growth (%)

✅ Filters (Top Row):

Time Period: Week / Month

Class Selector

Subject Selector

✅ Tabs Section (Buttons):
AI Assistant | Quiz | Test Generator | Summary | Notes
→ Each should show module-specific data when clicked.

✅ Charts Section (Middle):

Left: Line Chart → “Usage Trend” (Weekly/Monthly)

Center: Class-wise Chart

Right: Subject-wise Chart
→ All charts should update dynamically when filters change.

✅ Table Section (Bottom):
Columns:

Class

Subject

Total Interactions

Active Students
→ Show real data from backend. Add scroll for large data sets.

✅ Footer:
Include export options:

Export: PDF | Excel | Share Report

🧩 2️⃣ Data Logic & Backend Connection

Fetch data dynamically based on selected Class / Subject / Duration.

All data must come from actual AI usage logs (GiNi Assistant, Quiz, Test Generator, etc.)

Each tab should load relevant statistics from its module.

Ensure accurate total counts, average growth, and active user calculation.

🧩 3️⃣ Additional Enhancements

Add smooth chart animations and hover tooltips.

Make all cards clickable to drill down into detailed module reports.

Use consistent font, shadow, and card spacing for a professional school dashboard look.

Keep colors consistent with the current GiNi branding.

🎯 Goal

✅ Replicate and enhance the buyer’s dashboard sample.
✅ Keep all modules connected to live backend data.
✅ Don’t touch any other working functionality outside the dashboard.

After implementation, please test on:

Desktop & Mobile view
