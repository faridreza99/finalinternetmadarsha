Manual Blank Page Question Builder
(Teacher-First | AI-Optional | Rule-Safe)
1. CORE REQUIREMENT (VERY IMPORTANT)

The system MUST provide a Manual Blank Page Question Builder, where:

Teacher can start from a completely blank page

Teacher can build questions manually

AI is optional, not mandatory

All academic rules still apply automatically

This builder must feel like:

“I’m writing a real exam paper on paper — but digitally.”

2. WHEN THIS BUILDER IS USED

Teacher can choose ONE of THREE modes:

✅ Manual (Blank Page)

AI-Assisted (Section-wise)

AI-Generated (Full Paper)

This section defines Mode 1: Manual (Blank Page).

3. MANUAL BLANK PAGE BUILDER – ENTRY FLOW
Teacher clicks:

➕ Create New Question Paper

System asks:

Class

Subject

Exam Type

Total Marks (default 100)

Then teacher selects:

“Start from Blank Page (Manual)”

4. WHAT LOADS ON SCREEN (CRITICAL)
✅ Preloaded Automatically (LOCKED)

Branding Header (school name, logo, address)

Exam Meta:

Exam name

Class

Subject

Time

Full Marks (100)

Teacher cannot delete these.

✍️ Editable Area (BLANK)

Below the header:

Empty editor

No sections

No questions

No AI content

Teacher starts writing everything manually.

5. WHAT THE TEACHER CAN DO (MANUAL MODE)

Teacher can manually:

Type section titles
(e.g. “১. এক কথায় উত্তর দাও”)

Type questions freely

Decide:

How many sections

How many questions

Question wording

Assign marks per question

Reorder content freely

This is a free-form academic editor, not AI-driven.

6. WHAT THE SYSTEM STILL CONTROLS (IMPORTANT)

Even in manual mode, the system must ENFORCE RULES IN BACKGROUND.

Rule Enforcement (Silent but Strict):

❌ Teacher cannot add a section that is not allowed for that class

❌ Teacher cannot exceed MCQ limits

❌ Total marks ≠ 100 → submission blocked

❌ Disallowed section titles auto-flagged

Example warning:

“এই শ্রেণিতে ‘MCQ’ প্রশ্ন প্রযোজ্য নয়”

7. MANUAL SECTION CREATION LOGIC

When teacher types a section title:

System must:

Detect section type (by title or selection)

Validate against class-wise allowed sections

If invalid:

Block OR

Ask teacher to change section type

8. OPTIONAL AI HELP (INSIDE MANUAL MODE)

Even in blank mode:

Teacher can click:

“Suggest Questions for This Section”

“Improve Language”

AI will:

Only work on selected text

Never auto-generate whole paper

Never add new sections

AI is a helper, not an author.

9. DATA MODEL (MANUAL MODE COMPATIBLE)

Even manual content must be stored structurally.

{
  "paper_mode": "manual",
  "sections": [
    {
      "section_type": "short",
      "title": "সংক্ষিপ্ত প্রশ্ন",
      "questions": [
        {
          "text": "বাংলাদেশের রাজধানীর নাম লেখ।",
          "marks": 2
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

10. LOCKING, APPROVAL & PDF (SAME RULES APPLY)

Manual papers must still support:

Draft → Submit → Approve → Lock

Audit logs

Print-ready PDF export

Branding preserved

Section rules respected

No difference from AI papers after submission.

11. UI LABELING (VERY IMPORTANT)

The UI must clearly show:

📝 Manual Question Builder (Blank Page)
🤖 AI is OFF by default

This avoids teacher confusion and builds trust.

12. FINAL GUARANTEE

With this feature:

✅ Senior teachers can ignore AI completely
✅ Traditional question setters feel comfortable
✅ AI becomes optional, not forced
✅ System works for real schools

🔥 FINAL SYSTEM PRINCIPLE

AI is an assistant.
Teacher is the author.
Rules are the authority.
