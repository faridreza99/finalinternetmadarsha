Hi Replit Team,

We are still facing layout and data rendering issues in the Student ID Card, and it is not usable in its current form. Please review carefully.

❌ Current Problems (Critical)
1️⃣ Organization / Madrasah Name NOT Showing

The Madrasah / Organization name is missing or broken at the top.

It should come from School Branding → School Name.

Right now it either:

does not render at all, or

shows broken Bengali glyphs.

Expected:
✔ Full Madrasah name visible
✔ Proper Bengali font
✔ Center-aligned in header area

2️⃣ Student Details Are Incomplete / Cut

Not all student fields are visible.

Fields like:

Address

Mobile

Guardian info
are missing or clipped.

Expected fields (minimum):

Student Name

Father’s Name

Class / Section

Roll / ID

Mobile

Address

Layout must never clip or overflow text.

3️⃣ Signature & Seal Position Is WRONG

Principal signature and official seal are not in correct positions.

Currently floating / misaligned.

Expected (standard Madrasah format):

Seal → center bottom (back side)

Principal Signature → right bottom

Both must come from:

Uploaded seal image

Uploaded signature image

Fixed position (not dynamic / auto-flow)

4️⃣ Bengali Text Is Breaking

Bengali sentences are breaking into boxes / unreadable characters.

This indicates:

wrong font

font not embedded in PDF

Must fix by:

Using a proper Unicode Bengali font
(e.g. Noto Sans Bengali / SolaimanLipi)

Embedding font in PDF generation

Proper line-height and word-break

5️⃣ ID Card Must Be Portrait (Not Auto-Stretched)

Orientation must be strict portrait

No auto scaling

Required:

Fixed width & height (ID card ratio)

CSS + PDF config locked to portrait

Front & back aligned vertically

✅ Final Expected Output

Portrait ID card

Clear Madrasah name on top

Clean Bengali text

Full student details visible

Properly aligned:

Photo

Seal

Signature

Print-ready professional layout

This is a core production feature for Madrasah usage, so accuracy is critical.

Please confirm once:

Madrasah name renders correctly

Bengali font issue is fixed

Signature & seal are placed correctly

No student data is clipped

Thank you.
