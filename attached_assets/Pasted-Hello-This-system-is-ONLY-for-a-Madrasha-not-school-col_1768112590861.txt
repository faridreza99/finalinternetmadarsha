Hello,

This system is ONLY for a Madrasha (not school / college / university).
Please align the structure strictly according to standard Madrasha academic flow,
without touching or breaking existing features.

Required Madrasha Academic Structure

Marhala (e.g. Dakhil / Alim / Fazil)
 → Department (e.g. Science / Hadith / Tafsir)
    → Semester (Represents Madrasha Class / Jamaat / Course-equivalent unit)
       → Student
            → Attendance
            → Video Classes
            → Exams / MCQ
            → Fees

Important Terminology Clarification (Mandatory)

• Madrasha "Class / Jamaat" is treated as a complete course-equivalent unit.
• There must be NO separate Course entity.
• Internally, all Class / Jamaat / Course concepts MUST map to Semester.
• semester_id is the single operational reference across the system.

Very Important Rules

❗ Do NOT change or refactor existing modules:
- Attendance
- Video Classes
- Exam / MCQ
- Fee Collection
- Student Module

This is structure extension only, not redesign.

Expected System Behavior (Madrasha Standard)

Student Enrollment
- A student must be enrolled only in a Semester
- Student should NOT be directly linked to Marhala or Department
- semester_id must be the single operational reference

Attendance
- Attendance must be taken semester-wise
- Admin / Teacher can only take attendance for assigned semesters

Video Classes
- Video lessons must be created semester-wise
- Student should see only videos of their enrolled semester

Exams / MCQ
- Exams created per semester
- Results stored semester-wise

Fees
- Fee setup must be: Marhala + Department + Semester based
- Fee collection, paid, due, reports must be semester-wise
- Same student may have different fees in different semesters

Reports (No UI Redesign Needed)

All reports must be generated using:
- Semester
- Student
- Date range

Examples:
- Attendance Report
- Fee Paid / Due Report
- Exam Result Report
- Video Progress Report

Final Requirement

✔ Madrasha-only academic flow
✔ Semester-centric operations
✔ Existing system must remain intact
✔ Clean, real-world madrasha workflow

Please confirm once the Madrasha hierarchy is properly implemented
and all modules are aligned using semester_id.
