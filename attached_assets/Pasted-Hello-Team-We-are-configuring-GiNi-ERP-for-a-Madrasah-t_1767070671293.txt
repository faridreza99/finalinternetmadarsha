Hello Team,

We are configuring GiNi ERP for a Madrasah tenant
Tenant ID: MHAM5678 – Mohazampur Hafizia Atimkana Madrasha.

After full functional testing, I’d like to share critical usability feedback, especially from a Madrasah administrator’s perspective.
The system works technically, but the UI/UX is currently too complex for Madrasah use.

🔴 Key Problem: UI Is Not Madrasah-Friendly

Madrasah admins are usually:

Not finance/tech oriented

Used to very simple workflows

Prefer Bengali-first, minimal screens, fewer clicks

Currently:

Too many cards, stats, numbers

Too many English labels

Too many actions on one screen

This increases confusion and training time.

✅ Required UI Simplification (ONLY for MHAM5678)
🔹 1️⃣ Introduce “Madrasah Simple UI Mode”

Add a tenant-level flag:

{
  tenant_id: "MHAM5678",
  institution_type: "madrasah",
  ui_mode: "simple"
}


This must affect only this tenant, not global UI.

🔹 2️⃣ Simplified Fees Management UI (Madrasah Mode)
❌ Hide for Madrasah:

Graphs (Collected / Pending / Overdue cards)

Monthly Target

Transport Fees

Bulk Payment

Advanced Finance Reports

✅ Show Only:

Class-wise Monthly Fee

Paid / Unpaid status

Simple “Collect Fee” button

📌 One clean screen instead of 3–4 sections.

🔹 3️⃣ Example: Ideal Madrasah Fees Screen
বেতন ব্যবস্থাপনা

[ ক্লাস নির্বাচন ]
[ সেকশন নির্বাচন ]

ইবতেদায়ী ১ম বর্ষ – 300 টাকা
[ আদায় হয়েছে ] / [ বকেয়া ]

ইবতেদায়ী ২য় বর্ষ – 300 টাকা


No graphs, no analytics, no targets.

🔹 4️⃣ Bengali-First UI for Madrasah

Please replace English-heavy labels for this tenant:

Current	Madrasah UI
Fees Management	বেতন ব্যবস্থাপনা
Pending	বকেয়া
Collected	আদায় হয়েছে
Collect	আদায় করুন
Reports	রিপোর্ট
🔹 5️⃣ Reduce Clicks & Load Time

Avoid loading multiple APIs on one page

Load data only after class + section is selected

Cache sections for the selected class

Close modal instantly after save (background refresh)

This is important because slow loading creates trust issues for Madrasah admins.

🟢 Additional Notes (Important)
✔ AI Should Remain Enabled

Madrasah will use AI, especially:

AI Assistant

Notes / Summary

Quiz for Islamic subjects

Please do not hide AI modules for Madrasah tenants.

✔ ID Card Module Needs Improvement

Student ID Card:

Missing student photo

Missing Madrasah name & logo

Layout not standard

Staff ID Card:

Staff exists but not showing in ID card list

Likely filter / tenant mapping issue

🎯 Final Goal

We want GiNi ERP to feel:

Simple

Bengali-friendly

Madrasah-oriented

Usable without training

Please treat this as a Madrasah UX optimization, not just a feature change.

Let me know once:

Simple UI mode is applied

Fees UI is reduced

Performance is stable

I’ll retest everything from the Madrasah admin account.

Thanks & regards,
Farid
