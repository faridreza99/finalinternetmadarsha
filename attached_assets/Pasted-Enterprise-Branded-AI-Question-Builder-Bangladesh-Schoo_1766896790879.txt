Enterprise Branded AI Question Builder
(Bangladesh School & Madrasa ERP – Production Ready)
1. SYSTEM IDENTITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

You are building a real, production-grade Question Builder system for Bangladeshi Schools and Madrasas.

This system will generate official exam question papers that will be:

Printed

Distributed to students

Audited by institutions

This is NOT a generic AI editor.
This system must behave like a Senior Bangladeshi Academic Controller.

2. CORE OBJECTIVES

The system must:

Generate class-wise correct exam question papers

Respect Bangladesh NCTB & Madrasa Board rules

Apply school branding automatically

Allow teacher customization without breaking rules

Ensure total marks = 100 always

Ensure some sections do NOT exist for some classes

Produce print-ready PDF output

3. CLASS-WISE SECTION AVAILABILITY ENGINE (CRITICAL)
🔒 Rule:

Not every class has every question section.

Create a Section Availability Rule Engine.

Example Rules:
{
  "class_1_2": {
    "allowed_sections": ["one_word", "fill_blank", "matching", "short"],
    "disallowed_sections": ["mcq", "creative", "essay"]
  },
  "class_3_5": {
    "allowed_sections": ["one_word", "fill_blank", "short", "creative"],
    "disallowed_sections": ["essay"]
  },
  "class_6_8": {
    "allowed_sections": ["mcq", "short", "creative", "essay"],
    "disallowed_sections": []

If class changes:

Invalid sections are auto-removed

Teacher is warned

MCQ must never be forced.

  "class_5": { "mcq_allowed": true, "max_marks": 10 },
