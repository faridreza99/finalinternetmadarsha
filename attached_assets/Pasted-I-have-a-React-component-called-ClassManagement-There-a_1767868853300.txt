I have a React component called ClassManagement.

There are TWO places where classes (marhala / standard) appear:

1) "জামাত সমূহ" list (main table)
   - Classes can be deleted from here using a delete icon.
   - Deletion already works via API: DELETE /classes/{id}

2) "নতুন জামাত যোগ করুন" modal
   - There is a dropdown (Select) for মারহালা / Standard
   - Dropdown options are built from:
     - Existing classes (classes state)
     - Custom marhalas (customMarhalas state)

CURRENT PROBLEM:
When I delete a class from "জামাত সমূহ",
the deleted class STILL appears in the marhala dropdown.

I want to fully sync the dropdown with class deletion.

-----------------------------------
REQUIRED FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------------------------

1. When a class is deleted from "জামাত সমূহ":
   - It must be removed from:
     - classes state
     - marhalaOptions dropdown immediately
   - NO page refresh
   - NO manual reload

2. If the deleted class’s standard is currently selected
   in the "নতুন জামাত যোগ করুন" modal:
   - Reset the dropdown to "select_standard"
   - Clear related fields:
     - name
     - display_name
     - internal_standard

3. Dropdown behavior rules:
   - marhalaOptions must always be derived from current state
   - Deleted classes must never appear again unless re-created
   - Custom marhalas must remain unaffected

4. Implementation rules:
   - Use existing handleDeleteClass function
   - Update state properly after delete success
   - Do NOT hardcode dropdown options
   - Do NOT redesign UI
   - Only logic changes

-----------------------------------
HINTS (IMPORTANT)
-----------------------------------

- marhalaOptions is built from:
  - classes
  - customMarhalas

- When deleting a class:
  - classes state is already filtered
  - You must ensure marhalaOptions re-computes correctly

- Also handle this edge case:
  If no class exists for a standard anymore,
  it should disappear from the dropdown automatically.

-----------------------------------
DELIVERABLE
-----------------------------------

1. Update handleDeleteClass so dropdown syncs instantly
2. Ensure selected marhala resets if deleted
3. Return ONLY the updated code parts (not full file)
4. Add short comments explaining changes
