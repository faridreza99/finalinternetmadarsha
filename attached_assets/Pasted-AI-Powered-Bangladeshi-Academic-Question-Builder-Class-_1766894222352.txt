AI-Powered Bangladeshi Academic Question Builder
(Class-Wise | Rule-Based | Board-Compliant | ERP-Ready)
1. SYSTEM ROLE & IDENTITY

You are building an enterprise-grade Bangladeshi Academic Question Builder for schools and madrasas.

This system will be used by teachers, not students.

The system must strictly follow:

Bangladesh NCTB standards

Bangladesh Madrasa Board standards

Traditional Bangladeshi exam paper formats

This is NOT a generic AI question generator.
This is a rule-driven, class-aware, exam-safe system.

2. CORE OBJECTIVE

Build a system where:

Teachers can design exam question papers

AI assists only within strict academic rules

Each class has different question patterns

MCQ may or may not exist depending on class

Total marks must always equal 100

AI language is pure Bangladeshi academic Bangla

3. NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)
❌ AI MUST NEVER:

Force MCQ where class rules disallow it

Mix Bangla and English

Use informal or modern conversational Bangla

Repeat same question across different classes

Generate questions without syllabus context

Change total marks from 100

✅ AI MUST ALWAYS:

Obey class-wise exam rules

Use formal academic Bangla

Adjust language complexity per class

Respect teacher customization

Produce print-ready output

4. CLASS-WISE EXAM RULE ENGINE (MANDATORY)

Create a Rule Engine that controls question types per class.

Example Rule Configuration:
{
  "class_1_3": {
    "mcq_allowed": false,
    "allowed_question_types": [
      "one_word",
      "fill_blank",
      "matching",
      "short"
    ],
    "language_level": "very_simple",
    "total_marks": 100
  },
  "class_4_5": {
    "mcq_allowed": true,
    "max_mcq_marks": 10,
    "allowed_question_types": [
      "mcq",
      "short",
      "creative"
    ],
    "language_level": "simple_academic",
    "total_marks": 100
  },
  "class_6_8": {
    "mcq_allowed": true,
    "max_mcq_marks": 20,
    "allowed_question_types": [
      "mcq",
      "short",
      "creative",
      "essay"
    ],
    "language_level": "standard_academic",
    "total_marks": 100
  }
}


🔒 Teachers cannot override these rules.

5. TEACHER CUSTOMIZATION LOGIC

Teacher can:

Select Class

Select Subject

Select Chapter(s)

Select Exam Type

Select Total Questions (e.g. 10)

Select Difficulty

Enable/Disable allowed question types

Set marks per section

System must:

Validate total marks = 100

Block invalid configurations

Warn if structure violates board norms

6. TOTAL QUESTIONS VS TOTAL MARKS VALIDATION

If teacher sets:

Total Marks = 100

Total Questions = 10

System must:

Auto-calculate marks

OR allow teacher-defined distribution

Reject mismatched totals

Example Valid Structure:
Section A: 5 × 4 = 20
Section B: 3 × 10 = 30
Section C: 2 × 25 = 50
Total = 100

7. AI QUESTION GENERATION ENGINE
AI INPUT FORMAT (STRICT)
{
  "class": "৫ম",
  "subject": "বাংলা",
  "chapters": ["আমার দেশ", "বৃষ্টি"],
  "exam_type": "বার্ষিক",
  "total_marks": 100,
  "total_questions": 10,
  "mcq_allowed": true,
  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "language_style": "Bangladeshi academic Bangla"
}

8. AI LANGUAGE CONTROL (CRITICAL)
SYSTEM PROMPT (MUST BE USED)
You are a Bangladeshi school and madrasa question paper setter.
You write only pure Bangla.
You follow NCTB and Madrasa Board language.
You use formal academic examination language.
You adjust vocabulary and sentence length based on class.
You never use English words or mixed language.

9. CLASS-WISE LANGUAGE BEHAVIOR
Class	Language Style
১–৩	খুব সহজ ও ছোট বাক্য
৪–৫	সহজ একাডেমিক ভাষা
৬–৮	প্রমিত একাডেমিক ভাষা
৯–১০	বোর্ড-পর্যায়ের ভাষা
10. QUESTION PAPER FORMAT (PRINT READY)

AI output must match Bangladeshi exam paper style:

Bengali numbering (১, ২, ৩ / ক, খ, গ)

Clear section titles

Marks shown per question

Instructions in Bangla

No emojis, no markdown noise

11. QUESTION BANK & ANTI-REPETITION SYSTEM

Save every generated question

Tag by:

Class

Subject

Chapter

Difficulty

AI must check database before generating

Prevent same question reuse

12. EXPORT & DELIVERY

PDF (A4, Bangla font)

DOCX

Clean margins

Print-safe formatting

13. USER ROLES

Admin:

Define class rules

Monitor AI usage

Teacher:

14. SUCCESS CRITERIA

✅ Matches real Bangladeshi exam papers
✅ Teachers trust the system
✅ AI never breaks academic rules
✅ Class-wise uniqueness guaranteed
