Enterprise Attendance Management System
(Biometric + RFID + Manual + ERP Integrated)
1. SYSTEM ROLE & IDENTITY

You are building a production-grade Attendance Management System for real schools and madrasas in Bangladesh.

This system must work in live school environments, integrated with:

Biometric devices (Fingerprint / Face)

RFID cards (optional)

Manual attendance (fallback)

School ERP modules

This is NOT a demo system.
This is enterprise-ready, scalable, auditable, and secure.

2. CORE OBJECTIVES

The system must:

Accurately record student & staff attendance

Integrate with physical biometric devices

Support multiple attendance sources

Work offline & sync online

Enforce school policies automatically

Generate real academic reports

3. SUPPORTED ATTENDANCE MODES (MANDATORY)
✅ Attendance Sources

Biometric Device

Fingerprint

Face recognition

RFID / Smart Card

Manual Teacher Entry

Admin Override (logged & audited)

Each record must store:

Source type

Device ID

Timestamp

Verification status

4. BIOMETRIC DEVICE INTEGRATION (CRITICAL)
Supported Devices

ZKTeco

Hikvision

Suprema

Any TCP/IP biometric device

Integration Methods

TCP/IP Push (preferred)

REST API (if available)

Scheduled device polling

Offline sync support

Device Registration Model
{
  "device_id": "BIO-001",
  "device_type": "Fingerprint",
  "location": "Main Gate",
  "school_id": "SCH-001",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.10",
  "status": "active"
}

5. ATTENDANCE RULE ENGINE (VERY IMPORTANT)

Attendance behavior must be rule-driven, not random.

Rule Examples:

Late if after 09:00 AM

Absent if no check-in by 10:00 AM

Half-day if checkout before 1:00 PM

Friday / holiday auto-excluded

Exam days follow different rules

Rules must be:

Class-wise

Shift-wise

Institution-wise

6. STUDENT ATTENDANCE FLOW

Student scans fingerprint / face

Device validates locally

Data sent to ERP server

ERP:

Maps student ID

Applies attendance rules

Marks Present / Late / Absent

Parent notification sent (optional)

7. TEACHER & STAFF ATTENDANCE

Separate attendance logic

Supports:

Multiple shifts

Overtime

Leave integration

Used for:

Payroll

Performance reports

8. OFFLINE MODE & SYNC (MANDATORY)

Biometric devices must:

Work without internet

Store logs locally

Auto-sync when connection restored

ERP must:

Detect duplicate logs

Resolve conflicts safely

Never lose attendance data

9. DATA STRUCTURE (CORE TABLES)
Attendance Record
{
  "user_id": "STD-1023",
  "role": "student",
  "date": "2025-01-10",
  "check_in": "08:45",
  "check_out": "14:30",
  "status": "Present",
  "source": "biometric",
  "device_id": "BIO-001"
}

10. MANUAL ATTENDANCE (CONTROLLED)

Teachers can:

Take class attendance manually

Edit only same-day records

Restrictions:

Past edits require admin approval

All edits logged with reason

11. AI-ASSISTED ATTENDANCE INSIGHTS (OPTIONAL)

AI can:

Detect irregular attendance

Flag chronic absenteeism

Generate monthly insights

Predict dropout risk

AI must never auto-modify attendance.

12. PARENT NOTIFICATION SYSTEM

SMS / App notification on:

Late arrival

Absence

Language: Bangla

Configurable by school

13. REPORTING & EXPORTS

Generate:

Daily attendance sheet

Monthly summary

Class-wise attendance %

Student attendance history

Teacher attendance for payroll

Exports:

PDF

Excel

14. ROLES & PERMISSIONS
Admin

Configure devices

Define attendance rules

Override records (logged)

Teacher

Take manual attendance

View class reports

Student / Parent

View attendance only

15. SECURITY & COMPLIANCE

No biometric data stored as raw images

Store templates only (device-level)

Encrypted communication

Full audit logs
