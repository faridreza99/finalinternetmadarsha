Hi Replit Team,

Please implement the following new feature updates for the Mobile Shop ERP module to improve inventory and billing automation:

📋 Project Feature Requirements
1. Customer Due Tracking

Description:
If a customer does not pay the full amount for a purchase, the remaining balance should be recorded as a “due.”
Please add a new route/page to show all customer dues with:

Customer name

Total purchase amount

Amount paid

Remaining due

Transaction date

Expected Behavior:
Whenever a sale occurs with a partial payment, it automatically creates or updates a “due record” linked to that customer.

2. Pending & Return Stock Update

Description:
Stock quantities should automatically adjust during sales and returns.
Example:

Customer buys 10 units → Stock decreases by 10

Customer returns 5 units → Stock increases by 5

Expected Behavior:
Stock should update automatically in both purchase and return operations — no manual entry required.

3. Low Stock Alert

Description:
Trigger a low stock alert whenever a product quantity drops below 5 units.
This alert should appear on the dashboard and optionally as a notification badge.

Expected Behavior:

Real-time monitoring of product stock

“Low Stock” section or alert count visible on the dashboard

4. Supplier Information in Product Add Form

Description:
When adding a new product, there should be a dropdown or input field for selecting or entering the Supplier Name.
The supplier should be saved with the product details and displayed in the product list.

Expected Behavior:

Supplier name linked with each product

Helps trace product sources and manage supplier relationships

⚙️ Expected Integration Notes

All updates should apply only to Mobile Shop ERP tenants (business_type = "mobile_shop")

Maintain data isolation for other modules (e.g., CNF, Computer Shop, Pharmacy)

New pages should follow existing layout and sidebar styling

Thanks for your consistent work — once implemented, these features will make Mobile Shop ERP more powerful and production-ready. 🚀
